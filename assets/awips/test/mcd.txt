Areas affected...northeast TX and far southeast OK

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 181529Z - 181730Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...A brief tornado and localized damaging wind threat will
exist through early afternoon with mesovortices within a line of
low-topped convection moving east-northeast across northeast Texas.
A watch may be necessary if greater deepening into thunderstorms
occurs.

DISCUSSION...Several transient and generally weak mesovortices have
been noted around the Metroplex with a largely north/south-oriented
convective line moving east-northeastward. Low-level shear is quite
strong ahead of the line per area VWPs and will remain so into early
afternoon. Convective depth has been a limiting factor to more
persistent/stronger mesovortices, with a lack of CG lightning
production and echo tops to around 25k ft. It appears the northern
tip of 67-68 F surface dew points may be necessary for a consistent
severe threat. This should tend to ripple slowly southward into
early afternoon as the convective line occludes the rich low-level
moisture plume emanating north across east TX.
